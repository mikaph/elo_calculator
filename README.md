To run the server:

Open a terminal window and navigate to /elo_calculator/backend and run 'uvicorn main:app --reload'. (Remember to run pip install!)

Open another terminal window, navigate to /elo_calculator/frontend and run 'npm start'. (Same here, run npm install!)

This opens a browser in localhost:3000, data is fetched from localhost:8000.
